Here's a professional and detailed **Jira Story Description** for implementing **Data Quality Checks (Validation) on Archived Data**, incorporating all your requirements:

---

### **Jira Story Title:**

Implement Data Quality Checks for Archived Tables

---

### **Story Description:**

As part of our data archival and validation framework, we need to implement comprehensive **Data Quality (DQ) checks** to ensure the integrity and consistency of data between the **source (live systems)** and the **archived target (e.g., data lake or cold storage)**.

This story includes the development and automation of the following validation checks for archived tables:

---

### **Scope of Data Quality Checks:**

1. **Row Count Validation:**

   * Compare the total number of rows in each archived table with its corresponding source table.
   * Flag mismatches and log discrepancies.

2. **Schema / Column Validation:**

   * Validate that the number of columns and column names/types match between source and target.
   * Check for column presence, data types, and nullability constraints.

3. **Row-Level Checksum Validation:**

   * Generate and compare row-level checksums between source and target to detect any row-wise discrepancies.
   * Use a hash function on concatenated column values for each row.

4. **Column-Level Checksum Validation:**

   * Compute column-level checksums (e.g., aggregate hash or sum of column values) for each column in both source and target.
   * Identify potential data corruption or drift.

---

### **Reporting and Accessibility:**

* Generate detailed **Data Quality Validation Reports** in **PDF format** summarizing:

  * Validation outcomes (pass/fail)
  * Row/column discrepancies
  * Detailed logs for mismatched entities
* **Store reports in S3** with a defined folder structure for traceability (e.g., `s3://bucket-name/dq-reports/YYYY/MM/DD/`).
* Integrate with **Amazon QuickSight** to make reports **downloadable via dashboards** or visual interfaces.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria:**

* [ ] All 4 types of validation checks are implemented and configurable for multiple tables.
* [ ] DQ validation results are logged with clear pass/fail indicators.
* [ ] PDF reports are generated, stored in S3, and organized by date/table.
* [ ] Reports are accessible and downloadable from QuickSight.
* [ ] Solution is scalable and supports automation for nightly or batch jobs.

---

### **Notes:**

* Ensure reusability of validation logic across different table sets.
* Use parameterization/config files to define source-target table pairs.
* Ensure all sensitive data is masked or obfuscated in the report (if applicable).
* Incorporate retry and error handling for failed validations or report generations.

Here is a well-structured **Jira Story Description** for implementing **Audit Logging on Metadata Field Updates for Archived Data**:

---

### **Jira Story Title:**

Implement Audit Logging on Metadata Field Updates for Archived Data

---

### **Story Description:**

To improve traceability, compliance, and operational transparency of the data archival process, we need to implement **audit logging** that captures key **metadata and runtime information** for each archival job execution.

This story focuses on logging relevant **input configurations** and **Glue job metadata** after each archival run into a centralized **audit log table**.

---

### **Audit Metadata to Capture:**

#### ðŸ”¹ **Input Configuration Metadata:**

* **Retention Policy**: Duration for which data should be retained.
* **Legal Hold Flag**: Whether data is under legal hold (Y/N).
* **Archived Date**: Date when archival was performed.
* **Source Table Name**
* **Source Schema/Database**
* **Application Name**: Application or service name owning the data.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Glue Job Metadata:**

* **Glue Job Name**
* **Glue Job Run ID**
* **Job Run Timestamp**
* **Job Status** (e.g., `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`)
* **Validation Report Paths**: S3 path(s) to DQ report PDFs or logs.

---

### **Implementation Notes:**

* Capture metadata at the end of each archival job.
* Store the data in a structured **Audit Log Table** (e.g., in a database or in S3 as a Delta/Parquet/CSV file).
* Ensure the table supports querying by:

  * Job name, status, and date
  * Application or source table
  * Report availability (for downstream access)
* Ensure idempotency to avoid duplicate records for the same job run.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria:**

* [ ] All required metadata fields are logged for each archival job run.
* [ ] Audit log table is created with proper schema and partitioning (e.g., by date or job name).
* [ ] Glue jobs are enhanced to write metadata to the audit log table at the end of execution.
* [ ] Validation report paths are correctly linked in the log.
* [ ] Logs are accessible via Athena/QuickSight or other analytics tools.
* [ ] Error handling is in place for failed audit log writes (without blocking archival job).

---

### **Notes:**

* Follow data governance policies and access control on the audit log table.
* Future enhancement may include integrating audit logging with centralized monitoring or alerting systems.

Here are the **two Jira stories** with **Title**, **Description**, and **Comments**, clearly structured and ready for use in your Jira system.

## âœ… **Jira Story 1: Implement RRAC on Archived Data & Validation Reports**

---

### **Title:**

Implement Role-Based Row-Level Access Control (RRAC) on Archived Data & Validation Reports

---

### **Description:**

To ensure secure and compliant access to archived data and validation reports, implement **Role-Based Row-Level Access Control (RRAC)**. Access should be restricted such that:

* **Archived data and validation reports** can only be **viewed and accessed by users** who are authorized for their respective **application(s)**.
* Each piece of archived data is tagged with an **application name**.
* **User-application mappings** should be maintained so that access is granted only to the relevant user(s) based on the applications they are assigned to.
* Unauthorized users must not be able to access data or reports related to applications they are not permitted to view.

This ensures data security, regulatory compliance, and proper segregation of access.

---

### **Comments:**

* Based on the discussion with **Raju**, **AWS Lake Formation** can be used to grant fine-grained permissions at the **AWS Glue Data Catalog level** and **S3 path level**.
* This will ensure **only authorized users** can access archived data and reports for their assigned applications.
* Requires a mapping mechanism for **user â†’ application(s)** and enforcement of those permissions in AWS Lake Formation or via a custom access control layer.

## âœ… **Jira Story 2: Capture User Identity in Audit Logs from Airflow DAG Trigger**

---

### **Title:**

Capture User Identity (Airflow User or IAM User) Triggering DAG and Store in Audit Logs

---

### **Description:**

Enhance the current archival audit logging process by capturing the **identity of the user** who **triggered the Airflow DAG** (either via UI or API). This user information should be dynamically captured and stored in the **Audit Log table**, to enable:

* Better traceability of archival activities.
* Compliance with audit and monitoring requirements.
* Support for access-level tracking and issue resolution.

The goal is to automatically capture the **Airflow user or IAM user identity** at runtime, rather than relying on manual inputs.

---

### **Comments:**

* As of now, we've been **manually adding user name and email** in the Airflow DAG input config, and storing it in the audit log.
* This approach is error-prone and not scalable.
* This information should be **captured dynamically** during DAG execution.
* **Needs further discussion with Raju** to determine the best way to capture this (e.g., Airflow UI/API metadata, AWS IAM context, or other approaches).
