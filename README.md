**Date:** \[Insert Date]
**Attendees:** \[Insert Names]
**Subject:** Enhancements to Validation Report Accessibility, Audit Logs, and Data Access Control

### **Agenda Items & Discussion Summary**

---

#### **1. Validation Report Access via Amazon QuickSight**

**Current Implementation:**

* In the current setup, the validation report dashboard in Amazon QuickSight displays report URLs for all DAG runs.
* These URLs are publicly accessible to all users with access to QuickSight.

**Proposed Changes:**

* The dashboard should display report URLs **at the application level**, rather than for every DAG run.
* Reports should be **organized into separate folders** based on the application name.
* **S3 bucket policies** need to be configured so that only authorized users can access reports based on their application roles.
* Access to **event archived data** should also be restricted to users who have the corresponding application-level role permissions.

---

#### **2. Audit Logs**

**Current Implementation:**

* In the final step of the Airflow DAG, details such as Glue job metadata, input configuration, and S3 report paths are stored.
* Currently, user and email information is passed manually as part of the input JSON while triggering the DAG.

**Proposed Enhancements:**

* **Migrate audit log storage from DynamoDB to a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL)** to allow for structured querying and reporting.
* **Define proper column names** for audit log records to improve readability and data integrity.
* **User identification should be automated**, retrieved dynamically from the triggering context rather than being passed manually via input configuration.

---

#### **3. Action Items Requiring Discussion with Raju**

* Define a strategy for **role-based access control** (RBAC) in QuickSight to ensure users can only view/download validation reports and archived data relevant to their assigned applications.
* Explore methods to **retrieve user identity dynamically** (e.g., via Airflow context or IAM role mapping) for capturing audit log information without manual input.
* Conduct a **feasibility study on archived data retrieval** mechanisms based on user roles and permissions.
